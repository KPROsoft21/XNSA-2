# Agency_Website_Template

The Agency Website Template is a HTML & CSS template which is responsive across all screen sizes. The project was created to practice HTML & CSS concepts. The UIUX has been designed by me as well.

The agency website template can be used for various frontend client projects where a minimal, illsutration based website is required by the agency. The different agencies / clients, the template can be used for is web development agencies, digital security agencies, graphic designing agencies or social media agencies.

This is an HTML and CSS based website. For adding functionality and relationship to a database with respect to the contact form, additonal javascript script file will have to be added.
